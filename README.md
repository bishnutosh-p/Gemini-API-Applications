Gemini API Generative AI Querying
This project utilizes the Gemini API to query generative AI models based on image and text inputs, producing text outputs. The application is built using Python and offers a straightforward interface for interacting with the Gemini API, along with a Streamlit-based frontend.

Features
Image and Text Inputs: Accepts both image and text inputs for querying the Gemini API.
Text Output: Generates and retrieves text-based responses from the AI model.
Streamlit Interface: Provides an easy-to-use web interface for interaction with the application.
Modular Design: Easily extendable for different use cases or additional functionalities.
Requirements
Python 3.7+
Gemini API Key
Streamlit
