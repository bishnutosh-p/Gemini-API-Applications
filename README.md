# Gemini API Applications
## This project utilizes the Gemini API to query generative AI models based on image and text inputs, producing text outputs. The application is built using Python and offers a straightforward interface for interacting with the Gemini API.

## Features
Image and Text Inputs: Accepts both image and text inputs for querying the Gemini API.
Text Output: Generates and retrieves text-based responses from the AI model.
Easy-to-Use Interface: Simple Python-based command-line interface for interaction.
Modular Design: Easily extendable for different use cases or additional functionalities.

## Requirements
Python 3.7+
Gemini API Key
